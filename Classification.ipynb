    "# Android Malware Classification\n",
    "This notebook explains how to run the Malware classification with a step by step process. You will learn how to import data, how to train your custom model, how to optimize it and how to test it on unlabelled data\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "We created this notebook to make our code as understadable and easy to use as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "The Classification is a two layer process. We first exploit Static Features of application to determine weither or not it is a malware and based on this static classification we analyse Dynamic features (network traffic and API calls) to refine the decision.\n",
    "In this notebbok we will : \n",
    "- import all the library and program that we need;\n",
    "- load the datasets;\n",
    "- Train the static classifier;\n",
    "- Search for the optimal hyperparameters of the Static trained-classifier;\n",
    "- Test and evaluate the Static classification;\n",
    "-    (......)\n",
